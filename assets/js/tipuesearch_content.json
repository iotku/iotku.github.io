On the Oca\u00adri\u00adna of Time side, Cos\u00admo got a fair bit of flak about pre\u00advi\u00adous\u00adly (has since been de\u00adfeat\u00aded) gain\u00ading the Any% ~World Record~ on an \"ob\u00adscure\" Chi\u00adnese re\u00adlease of the N64 (with dif\u00adfer\u00adences that make it faster than both N64 and VC), the iQue, in\u00adstead of the gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adly ac\u00adcept\u00aded Vir\u00adtu\u00adal Con\u00adsole re\u00adlease. While on the Su\u00adper Mario 64 side, the main fight is be\u00adtween N64 and VC which re\u00admoves near\u00adly all lag, which as a re\u00adsult a lot of chal\u00adlenge in lag re\u00adduc\u00adtion and saves a bunch of ex\u00adtra time. \n I don't have as big of an in\u00adter\u00adest in the Oca\u00adri\u00adna of Time side of this be\u00adcause I don't run the game, how\u00adev\u00ader it gives me per\u00adspec\u00adtive on the oth\u00ader side of the fence. In the OOT camp N64 is pret\u00adty ac\u00adcept\u00adable (gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adly be\u00adcause a glitch ex\u00adclu\u00adsive to 1.0 ver\u00adsion which was on\u00adly re\u00adleased on the N64 I be\u00adlieve), but so is VC due to it be\u00ading a \"Faster Of\u00adfi\u00adcial Re\u00adlease\" (less lag main\u00adly). So at this point the com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adty has al\u00adready es\u00adtab\u00adlished that they on\u00adly care about \"This game runs the fastest and it's an of\u00adfi\u00adcial re\u00adlease\", that seems to be the main cri\u00adte\u00adri\u00ada. Giv\u00aden what I in\u00adter\u00adpret the OOT com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adty to care about on\u00adly be\u00ading the fastest I was pret\u00adty shocked to see the out\u00adrage over the iQue. Sure it's not easy to get a hold of, cheap, etc; nei\u00adther is a 1.0 N64 cart from my un\u00adder\u00adstand\u00ading. Do you have to get a \"World Record\"? No. You could buy an iQue in or\u00adder to save 13~ sec\u00adond\u00ads, or you could just con\u00adtin\u00adue play\u00ading on your ver\u00adsion re\u00adgard\u00adless and stop wor\u00adry\u00ading about some \"Ob\u00adscure Chi\u00adnese con\u00adsole\". You can still be a com\u00adpet\u00adi\u00adtive play\u00ader re\u00adgard\u00adless of be\u00ading on a slight\u00adly slow\u00ader plat\u00adfor\u00adm, you just get less free time. \n As for Su\u00adper Mario 64, I have a bit more in\u00adter\u00adest in\u00adto the fight be\u00adtween N64 and VC as I run the game my\u00adself on the \"s\u00adlow\u00ader\" plat\u00adform N64. A lot of the \"big\u00adger names\" in the SM64 speedrun\u00adning com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adty de\u00adtest VC; the gen\u00ader\u00adal rea\u00adson seems to be around the lines of it be\u00ading \"less skill\u00adful\". The es\u00adti\u00admate that gets thrown around (if I re\u00admem\u00adber cor\u00adrect\u00adly) off the top of my head is that VC saves 1:30 in a 120 star run vs N64 with good lag re\u00adduc\u00adtion strat\u00ads. That's cer\u00adtain\u00adly more than 13~ sec\u00adond\u00ads, a big amount of time in a very tech\u00adni\u00adcal game. You al\u00adso don't need to put in any ef\u00adfort in\u00adto lag re\u00adduc\u00adtion, mak\u00ading VC less of a chal\u00adlenge in some cas\u00ades, as you don't have to fight with the cam\u00adera as much. Even\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly af\u00adter some fight\u00ading among pret\u00adty much ev\u00adery\u00adone the Ja\u00adpa\u00adnese leader\u00adboard sep\u00ada\u00adrat\u00aded VC from N64 (and oth\u00aders fol\u00adlowed along) much of the prob\u00adlem got set\u00adtled. While peo\u00adple still ar\u00adgue about the ver\u00adsion, many less ar\u00adgue about the com\u00adpar\u00adi\u00adson. \n While nei\u00adther of these cas\u00ades are ex\u00adact\u00adly clear cut, they're all tech\u00adni\u00adcal\u00adly Nin\u00adten\u00addo re\u00adleased ver\u00adsions of the same games, I feel that the main is\u00adsue is com\u00adpar\u00ading ap\u00adples to or\u00adanges. Why should we di\u00adrect\u00adly com\u00adpare dif\u00adfer\u00adent ver\u00adsions that have big enough dif\u00adfer\u00adences that peo\u00adple fight al\u00admost ev\u00adery day over them? The sim\u00adpler so\u00adlu\u00adtion is to just sep\u00ada\u00adrate ev\u00adery\u00adthing and if any\u00adone cares enough they can com\u00adpare on their own (or with au\u00adto\u00admat\u00aded help). Sure it would be nice to know the best times for each ver\u00adsion, but that does\u00adn't mean ev\u00adery\u00adthing should be com\u00adbined in the first place. If some\u00adbody wants to com\u00adpare the best VC time with iQue times they can check it on their own. If some\u00adone wants to com\u00adpare PAL sm64 to Japane\u00adse/Amer\u00adi\u00adcan NTSC they can do so al\u00adso. It's not re\u00adal\u00adly that dif\u00adfi\u00adcult to do, even on a sep\u00ada\u00adrat\u00aded leader\u00adboard.",
